How to assemble
---------------

1: download and install Cheat Engine http://www.cheatengine.org/

2: Open .ct file

How to run
----------

Run the game, run the trainer. If the trainer doesn\'t detect the game, 
press 0 on keypad (you'll hear "trainer initialized").

Use numpad keys to navigate. The coordinates are relative to the level size,
so some levels might require quite aggressive presses. Use Ctrl + numpad keys
for these levels.

Reinitialze the trainer after levels are switched, otherwize game will crash.

Enjoy!
